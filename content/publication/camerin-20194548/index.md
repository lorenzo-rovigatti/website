abstract: Soft particles display highly versatile properties with respect to hard
  colloids and even more so at fluid-fluid interfaces. In particular, microgels, consisting
  of a cross-linked polymer network, are able to deform and flatten upon adsorption
  at the interface due to the balance between surface tension and internal elasticity.
  Despite the existence of experimental results, a detailed theoretical understanding
  of this phenomenon is still lacking due to the absence of appropriate microscopic
  models. In this work, we propose an advanced modeling of microgels at a flat water/oil
  interface. The model builds on a realistic description of the internal polymeric
  architecture and single-particle properties of the microgel and is able to reproduce
  its experimentally observed shape at the interface. Complementing molecular dynamics
  simulations with in situ cryo-electron microscopy experiments and atomic force microscopy
  imaging after Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, we compare the morphology of the microgels
  for different values of the cross-linking ratios. Our model allows for a systematic
  microscopic investigation of soft particles at fluid interfaces, which is essential
  to develop predictive power for the use of microgels in a broad range of applications,
  including the stabilization of smart emulsions and the versatile patterning of surfaces.

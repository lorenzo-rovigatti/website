abstract: By using oxDNA, a coarse-grained nucleotide-level model of DNA, we are able
  to directly simulate the self-assembly of a small 384-base-pair origami from single-stranded
  scaffold and staple strands in solution. In general, we see attachment of new staple
  strands occurring in parallel, but with cooperativity evident for the binding of
  the second domain of a staple if the adjacent junction is already partially formed.
  For a system with exactly one copy of each staple strand, we observe a complete
  assembly pathway in an intermediate temperature window; at low temperatures successful
  assembly is prevented by misbonding while at higher temperature the free-energy
  barriers to assembly become too large for assembly on our simulation time scales.
  For high-concentration systems involving a large staple strand excess, we never
  see complete assembly because there are invariably instances where two copies of
  the same staple both bind to the scaffold, creating a kinetic trap that prevents
  the complete binding of either staple. This mutual staple blocking could also lead
  to aggregates of partially formed origamis in real systems, and helps to rationalize
  certain successful origami design strategies. Â© 2016 American Chemical Society.

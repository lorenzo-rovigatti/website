abstract: DNA oligomers with properly designed sequences self-assemble into well defined
  constructs. Here, we exploit this methodology to produce bulk quantities of tetravalent
  DNA nanostars (each one composed of 196 nucleotides) and to explore the structural
  signatures of their aggregation process. We report small-angle neutron scattering
  experiments focused on the evaluation of both the form factor and the temperature
  evolution of the scattered intensity at a nanostar concentration where the system
  forms a tetravalent equilibrium gel. We also perform molecular dynamics simulations
  of one isolated tetramer to evaluate the form factor numerically, without resorting
  to any approximate shape. The numerical form factor is found to be in very good
  agreement with the experimental one. Simulations predict an essentially temperature-independent
  form factor, offering the possibility to extract the effective structure factor
  and its evolution during the equilibrium gelation. Â© 2016 Author(s).

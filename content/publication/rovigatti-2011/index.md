abstract: We report accurate calculations of the particle density of states in the
  dipolar hard-sphere fluid. Implementing efficient and tailored Monte Carlo algorithms,
  we are able to explore, in equilibrium, the low temperature region where a phase
  separation between a dilute gas of chain ends and a high-density liquid of chain
  junctions has been predicted to occur. Our data clearly show that the density of
  states remains always single peaked, definitively excluding the possibility of critical
  phenomena in the investigated temperature and density region. The analysis of the
  low temperature configurations shows that at low densities particles preferentially
  self-assemble into closed rings, strongly suppressing the chain ends concentration.

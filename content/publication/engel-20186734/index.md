abstract: 'The mechanical properties of DNA nanostructures are of widespread interest
  as applications that exploit their stability under constant or intermittent external
  forces become increasingly common. We explore the force response of DNA origami
  in comprehensive detail by combining AFM single molecule force spectroscopy experiments
  with simulations using oxDNA, a coarse-grained model of DNA at the nucleotide level,
  to study the unravelling of an iconic origami system: the Rothemund tile. We contrast
  the force-induced melting of the tile with simulations of an origami 10-helix bundle.
  Finally, we simulate a recently proposed origami biosensor, whose function takes
  advantage of origami behavior under tension. We observe characteristic stick-slip
  unfolding dynamics in our force-extension curves for both the Rothemund tile and
  the helix bundle and reasonable agreement with experimentally observed rupture forces
  for these systems. Our results highlight the effect of design on force response:
  we observe regular, modular unfolding for the Rothemund tile that contrasts with
  strain-softening of the 10-helix bundle which leads to catastropic failure under
  monotonically increasing force. Further, unravelling occurs straightforwardly from
  the scaffold ends inward for the Rothemund tile, while the helix bundle unfolds
  more nonlinearly. The detailed visualization of the yielding events provided by
  simulation allows preferred pathways through the complex unfolding free-energy landscape
  to be mapped, as a key factor in determining relative barrier heights is the extensional
  release per base pair broken. We shed light on two important questions: how stable
  DNA nanostructures are under external forces and what design principles can be applied
  to enhance stability. Â© 2018 American Chemical Society.'

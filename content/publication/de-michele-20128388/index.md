abstract: Short blunt-ended DNA duplexes comprising 6 to 20 base pairs self-assemble
  into polydisperse semi-flexible chains due to hydrophobic stacking interactions
  between terminal base pairs. Above a critical concentration, which depends on temperature
  and duplex length, such chains order into liquid crystal phases. Here, we investigate
  the self-assembly of such double-helical duplexes with a combined numerical and
  theoretical approach. We simulate the bulk system employing the coarse-grained DNA
  model recently proposed by Ouldridge et al. [J. Chem. Phys., 2011, 134, 08501].
  Then we evaluate the input quantities for the theoretical framework directly from
  the DNA model. The resulting parameter-free theoretical predictions provide an accurate
  description of the simulation results in the isotropic phase and theoretical values
  for the isotropic-nematic phase boundaries which are in line with experimental findings.
  In addition, the developed theoretical framework makes it possible to provide a
  route to estimate the stacking free energy. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

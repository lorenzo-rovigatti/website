abstract: 'We introduce a sequence-dependent parametrization for a coarse-grained
  DNA model [T. E. Ouldridge, A. A. Louis, and J. P. K. Doye, J. Chem. Phys. 134,
  085101 (2011)]10.1063/1.3552946 originally designed to reproduce the properties
  of DNA molecules with average sequences. The new parametrization introduces sequence-dependent
  stacking and base-pairing interaction strengths chosen to reproduce the melting
  temperatures of short duplexes. By developing a histogram reweighting technique,
  we are able to fit our parameters to the melting temperatures of thousands of sequences.
  To demonstrate the flexibility of the model, we study the effects of sequence on:
  (a) the heterogeneous stacking transition of single strands, (b) the tendency of
  a duplex to fray at its melting point, (c) the effects of stacking strength in the
  loop on the melting temperature of hairpins, (d) the force-extension properties
  of single strands, and (e) the structure of a kissing-loop complex. Where possible,
  we compare our results with experimental data and find a good agreement. A simulation
  code called oxDNA, implementing our model, is available as a free software. © 2012

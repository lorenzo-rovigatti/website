abstract: In this contribution, we investigate the low-temperature, low-density behaviour
  of dipolar hard-sphere (DHS) particles, i.e., hard spheres with dipoles embedded
  in their centre. We aim at describing the DHS fluid in terms of a network of chains
  and rings (the fundamental clusters) held together by branching points (defects)
  of different nature. We first introduce a systematic way of classifying inter-cluster
  connections according to their topology, and then employ this classification to
  analyse the geometric and thermodynamic properties of each class of defects, as
  extracted from state-of-the-art equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations. By computing
  the average density and energetic cost of each defect class, we find that the relevant
  contribution to inter-cluster interactions is indeed provided by (rare) three-way
  junctions and by four-way junctions arising from parallel or anti-parallel locally
  linear aggregates. All other (numerous) defects are either intra-cluster or associated
  to low cluster-cluster interaction energies, suggesting that these defects do not
  play a significant part in the thermodynamic description of the self-assembly processes
  of dipolar hard spheres. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

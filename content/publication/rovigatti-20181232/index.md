abstract: 'We numerically investigate the self-dynamics and collective dynamics of
  a simple model for vitrimers - polymeric covalent networks that have the ability
  to dynamically rearrange the bond structure via exchange reactions, preserving the
  total connectivity. Specifically, we study a binary mixture of tetrafunctional and
  bifunctional particles by means of molecular dynamics simulations that naturally
  incorporate the bond-swapping mechanism. We specifically focus on the dynamics at
  small wavevector q by simulating 800 »000 particles. We observe two distinct collective
  relaxation processes: (i) a fast vibrational damped mode and (ii) a slow network
  restructuring dynamics. Unexpectedly, the slow process is characterized by a wavevector-independent
  (q0) mode originating from the swap motion of the bonds. © 2018 American Chemical
  Society.'

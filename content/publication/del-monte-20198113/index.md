abstract: Recent progress has been made in the numerical modelling of neutral microgel
  particles with a realistic, disordered structure. In this work we extend this approach
  to the case of co-polymerised microgels where a thermoresponsive polymer is mixed
  with acidic groups. We compare the cases where counterions directly interact with
  microgel charges or are modelled implicitly through a Debye-Hückel description.
  We do so by performing extensive numerical simulations of single microgels across
  the volume phase transition (VPT) varying the temperature and the fraction of charged
  monomers. We find that the presence of charges considerably alters the microgel
  structure, quantified by the monomer density profiles and by the form factors of
  the microgels, particularly close to the VPT. We observe significant deviations
  between the implicit and explicit models, with the latter comparing more favourably
  to available experiments. In particular, we observe a shift of the VPT temperature
  to larger values as the amount of charged monomers increases. We also find that
  below the VPT the microgel-counterion complex is almost neutral, while it develops
  a net charge above the VPT. Interestingly, under these conditions the collapsed
  microgel still retains a large amount of counterions inside its structure. Since
  these interesting features cannot be captured by the implicit model, our results
  show that it is crucial to explicitly include the counterions in order to realistically
  model ionic thermoresponsive microgels. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

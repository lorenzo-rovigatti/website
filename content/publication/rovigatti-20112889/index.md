abstract: We discuss the results of intensive Brownian dynamics simulations of a simple
  model of tetrahedral patchy particles in the optimal network density region. This
  choice allows us to investigate the evolution of the structure and of the dynamics
  in a wide range of temperatures without encountering any phase separation. The slowing
  down of the dynamics in this model system is driven by the progressive bond formation
  and the increasing bond lifetime. Although dynamical arrest is different from the
  glass case, where excluded volume interactions are dominant, the decay of the self-
  and collective correlation functions of the resulting fluid bears similarities with
  that observed in glassy systems. Copyright Â© 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

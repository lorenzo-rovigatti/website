abstract: We investigate the phase behaviour of charged soft dumbbells, particles
  composed of two soft but oppositely charged sites, as a function of the separation
  between the sites. Through successive umbrella sampling Monte Carlo simulations,
  we evaluate the equilibrium particle density of states. For elongated dumbbells,
  we recover the expected critical behaviour. However, reducing the elongation we
  are unable to locate the gas-liquid critical point in the accessible region of temperature
  and density. Correspondingly, the self-assembly of the particles in ring structures
  becomes dominant with respect to the formation of chain-like structures. Our results
  enrich the debate on the competition between self-assembly and phase separation
  and contribute to the long-standing dilemma about the putative gas-liquid criticality
  in dipolar fluids. Â© 2013 Taylor & Francis.

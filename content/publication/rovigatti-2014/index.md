abstract: We evaluate, by means of molecular dynamics simulations employing a realistic
  DNA coarse-grained model, the phase behaviour and the structural and dynamic properties
  of tetravalent DNA nanostars, i.e., nanoconstructs completely made of DNA. We find
  that, as the system is cooled down, tetramers undergo a gas-liquid phase separation
  in a region of concentrations which, if the difference in salt concentration is
  taken into account, is comparable with the recently measured experimental phase
  diagram [S. Biffi, R. Cerbino, F. Bomboi, E. M. Paraboschi, R. Asselta, F. Sciortino,
  and T. Bellini, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 15633 (2013)]. We also present
  a mean-field free energy for modelling the phase diagram based on the bonding contribution
  derived by Wertheim in his studies of associating liquids. Combined with mass-action
  law expressions appropriate for DNA binding and a numerically evaluated reference
  free energy, the resulting free energy qualitatively reproduces the numerical data.
  Finally, we report information on the nanostar structure, e.g., geometry and flexibility
  of the single tetramer and of the collective behaviour, providing a useful reference
  for future small angle scattering experiments, for all investigated temperatures
  and concentrations. Â© 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

abstract: "Polymer brushes are being increasingly used to tailor surface physicochemistry\
  \ for diverse applications such as wetting, adhesion of biological objects, implantable\
  \ devices and much more. Here we perform Dissipative Particle Dynamics simulations\
  \ to study the behaviour of dense polymer brushes under flow in a slit-pore channel.\
  \ We discover that the system displays flow inversion at the brush interface for\
  \ several disconnected ranges of the imposed flow. We associate such phenomenon\
  \ to collective polymer dynamics: a wave propagating on the brush surface. The relation\
  \ between the wavelength, the amplitude and the propagation speed of the flow-generated\
  \ wave is consistent with the solution of the Stokes equations when an imposed traveling\
  \ wave is assumed as the boundary condition (the famous Taylor's swimmer)."

abstract: 'With the help of a unique combination of density functional theory and
  computer simulations, we discover two possible scenarios, depending on concentration,
  for the hierarchical self-assembly of magnetic nanoparticles on cooling. We show
  that typically considered low temperature clusters, i.e. defect-free chains and
  rings, merge into more complex branched structures through only three types of defects:
  four-way X junctions, three-way Y junctions and two-way Z junctions. Our accurate
  calculations reveal the predominance of weakly magnetically responsive rings cross-linked
  by X defects at the lowest temperatures. We thus provide a strategy to fine-tune
  magnetic and thermodynamic responses of magnetic nanocolloids to be used in medical
  and microfluidics applications. This journal is Â© the Owner Societies 2015.'

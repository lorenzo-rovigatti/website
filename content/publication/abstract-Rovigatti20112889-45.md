abstract = "We discuss the results of intensive Brownian dynamics simulations of a simple model of tetrahedral patchy particles in the optimal network density region. This choice allows us to investigate the evolution of the structure and of the dynamics in a wide range of temperatures without encountering any phase separation. The slowing down of the dynamics in this model system is driven by the progressive bond formation and the increasing bond lifetime. Although dynamical arrest is different from the glass case, where excluded volume interactions are dominant, the decay of the self- and collective correlation functions of the resulting fluid bears similarities with that observed in glassy systems.

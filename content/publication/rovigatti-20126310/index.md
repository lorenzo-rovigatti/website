abstract: Through extensive state-of-the-art numerical simulations, we study the behavior
  of the dipolar hard sphere model at low temperatures and low densities, shedding
  light on a region of the phase diagram where a topological phase transition has
  long been thought to occur. We show that the system exhibits remarkable and unusual
  behaviors, like a very low density percolation locus and a stabilization of rings
  over chain structures. This unexpected abundance of rings comes from a delicate
  balance between the lower ring energy and the end-to-end chain entropy, and hints
  at a possible mechanism for the suppression of the gas-liquid phase separation.
  Our results open the possibility for refined theoretical approaches which, in addition
  to the previously encompassed chain and branched geometries, must also include the
  significant contribution arising from ring formation. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of

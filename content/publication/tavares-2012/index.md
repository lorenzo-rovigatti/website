abstract: We numerically study a simple fluid composed of particles having a hard-core
  repulsion complemented by two patchy attractive sites on the particle poles. An
  appropriate choice of the patch angular width allows for the formation of ring structures
  which, at low temperatures and low densities, compete with the growth of linear
  aggregates. The simplicity of the model makes it possible to compare simulation
  results and theoretical predictions based on the Wertheim perturbation theory, specialized
  to the case in which ring formation is allowed. Such a comparison offers a unique
  framework for establishing the quality of the analytic predictions. We find that
  the Wertheim theory describes remarkably well the simulation results. Â© 2012 American

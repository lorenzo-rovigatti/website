abstract: We present a numerical study in which large-scale bulk simulations of self-assembled
  DNA constructs have been carried out with a realistic coarse-grained model. The
  investigation aims at obtaining a precise, albeit numerically demanding, estimate
  of the free energy for such systems. We then, in turn, use these accurate results
  to validate a recently proposed theoretical approach that builds on a liquid-state
  theory, theWertheim theory, to compute the phase diagram of all-DNA fluids. This
  hybrid theoretical/numerical approach, based on the lowest-order virial expansion
  and on a nearest-neighbor DNA model, can provide, in an undemanding way, a parameter-free
  thermodynamic description of DNA associating fluids that is in semi-quantitative
  agreement with experiments. We show that the predictions of the scheme are as accurate
  as those obtained with more sophisticated methods. We also demonstrate the flexibility
  of the approach by incorporating non-trivial additional contributions that go beyond
  the nearest-neighbor model to compute the DNA hybridization free energy. Â© 2018

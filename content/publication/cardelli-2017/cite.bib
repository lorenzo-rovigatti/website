 abstract = {Heteropolymers are important examples of self-assembling systems. However, in the design of artificial heteropolymers the control over the single chain self-assembling properties does not reach that of the natural bio-polymers, and in particular proteins. Here, we introduce a sufficiency criterion to identify polymers that can be designed to adopt a predetermined structure and show that it is fulfilled by polymers made of monomers interacting through directional (anisotropic) interactions. The criterion is based on the appearance of a particular peak in the radial distribution function, that we show being a universal feature of all designable heteropolymers, as it is present also in natural proteins. Our criterion can be used to engineer new self-assembling modular polymers that will open new avenues for applications in materials science. Â© 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract: Heteropolymers are important examples of self-assembling systems. However,
  in the design of artificial heteropolymers the control over the single chain self-assembling
  properties does not reach that of the natural bio-polymers, and in particular proteins.
  Here, we introduce a sufficiency criterion to identify polymers that can be designed
  to adopt a predetermined structure and show that it is fulfilled by polymers made
  of monomers interacting through directional (anisotropic) interactions. The criterion
  is based on the appearance of a particular peak in the radial distribution function,
  that we show being a universal feature of all designable heteropolymers, as it is
  present also in natural proteins. Our criterion can be used to engineer new self-assembling
  modular polymers that will open new avenues for applications in materials science.

abstract: Microgels are colloidal-scale particles individually made of cross-linked
  polymer networks that can swell and deswell in response to external stimuli, such
  as changes to temperature or pH. Despite a large amount of experimental activities
  on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties
  is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further,
  here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles in
  silico. We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent
  (cross-linkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement
  in order to produce fully bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used
  to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated
  with a bead-spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction.
  To validate our assembly protocol, we focus on a small microgel test case and show
  that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the
  confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated
  assembly methodologies, e.g., in the case of networks generated from an underlying
  crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real
  space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding
  that our results are well described by the widely used fuzzy sphere model. This
  is a first step toward a realistic modeling of microgel particles, which will pave
  the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.

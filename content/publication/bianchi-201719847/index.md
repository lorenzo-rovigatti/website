abstract: 'Limited bonding valence, usually accompanied by well-defined directional
  interactions and selective bonding mechanisms, is nowadays considered among the
  key ingredients to create complex structures with tailored properties: even though
  isotropically interacting units already guarantee access to a vast range of functional
  materials, anisotropic interactions can provide extra instructions to steer the
  assembly of specific architectures. The anisotropy of effective interactions gives
  rise to a wealth of self-assembled structures both in the realm of suitably synthesized
  nano- and micro-sized building blocks and in nature, where the isotropy of interactions
  is often a zero-th order description of the complicated reality. In this review,
  we span a vast range of systems characterized by limited bonding valence, from patchy
  colloids of new generation to polymer-based functionalized nanoparticles, DNA-based
  systems and proteins, and describe how the interaction patterns of the single building
  blocks can be designed to tailor the properties of the target final structures.

abstract: We present a numerical/theoretical approach to efficiently evaluate the
  phase diagram of self-assembling DNA nanostars. Combining input information based
  on a realistic coarse-grained DNA potential with the Wertheim association theory,
  we derive a parameter-free thermodynamic description of these systems. We apply
  this method to investigate the phase behavior of single components and mixtures
  of DNA nanostars with different numbers of sticky arms, elucidating the role of
  the system functionality and of salt concentration. Specifically, we evaluate the
  propensity to demix, the gas-liquid phase boundaries and the location of the critical
  points. The predicted critical parameters compare very well with existing experimental
  results for the available compositions. The approach developed here is very general,
  easily extensible to other all-DNA systems, and provides guidance for future experiments.

abstract: We investigate, via numerical simulations, mean field, and density functional
  theories, the magnetic response of a dipolar hard sphere fluid at low temperatures
  and densities, in the region of strong association. The proposed parameter-free
  theory is able to capture both the density and temperature dependence of the ring-chain
  equilibrium and the contribution to the susceptibility of a chain of generic length.
  The theory predicts a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the initial (zero field)
  magnetic susceptibility, arising from the competition between magnetically inert
  particle rings and magnetically active chains. Monte Carlo simulation results closely
  agree with the theoretical findings. Â© 2013 American Physical Society.

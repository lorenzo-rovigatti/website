abstract: We investigate binary mixtures of large colloids interacting through soft
  potentials with small, ideal depletants. We show that softness has a dramatic effect
  on the resulting colloid-colloid effective potential when the depletant-to-colloid
  size ratio q is small, with significant consequences on the colloidal phase behaviour.
  We provide an exact relationship that allows us to obtain the effective pair potential
  for any type of colloid-depletant interaction in the case of ideal depletants, without
  having to rely on complicated and expensive full-mixture simulations. We also show
  that soft repulsion among depletants further enhances the tendency of colloids to
  aggregate. Our theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that-in the limit of
  small q-soft mixtures cannot be mapped onto hard systems and hence soft depletion
  is not a mere extension of the widely used Asakura-Oosawa potential. This journal

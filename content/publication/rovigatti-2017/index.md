abstract: A re-entrant gas-liquid spinodal was proposed as a possible explanation
  of the apparent divergence of the compressibility and specific heat off supercooling
  water. Such a counter-intuitive possibility, e.g., a liquid that becomes unstable
  to gas-like fluctuations on cooling at positive pressure, has never been observed,
  neither in real substances nor in off-lattice simulations. More recently, such a
  re-entrant scenario has been dismissed on the premise that the re-entrant spinodal
  would collide with the gas-liquid coexisting curve (binodal) in the pressure-temperature
  plane. Here we study, numerically and analytically, two previously introduced one-component
  patchy particle models that both show (i) a re-entrant limit of stability of the
  liquid phase and (ii) a re-entrant binodal, providing a neat in silico (and in charta)
  realization of such unconventional thermodynamic scenario. Â© 2017 Author(s).

abstract: Microgels are complex macromolecules. These colloid-sized polymer networks
  possess internal degrees of freedom and, depending on the polymer(s) they are made
  of, can acquire a responsiveness to variations of the environment (temperature,
  pH, salt concentration, etc.). Besides being valuable for many practical applications,
  microgels are also extremely important to tackle fundamental physics problems. As
  a result, these last years have seen a rapid development of protocols for the synthesis
  of microgels, and more and more research has been devoted to the investigation of
  their bulk properties. However, from a numerical standpoint the picture is more
  fragmented, as the inherently multi-scale nature of microgels, whose bulk behaviour
  crucially depends on the microscopic details, cannot be handled at a single level
  of coarse-graining. Here we present an overview of the methods and models that have
  been proposed to describe non-ionic microgels at different length-scales, from the
  atomistic to the single-particle level. We especially focus on monomer-resolved
  models, as these have the right level of details to capture the most important properties
  of microgels, responsiveness and softness. We suggest that these microscopic descriptions,
  if realistic enough, can be employed as starting points to develop the more coarse-grained
  representations required to investigate the behaviour of bulk suspensions. Â© 2019

abstract: We present a concise review of the large variety of self-assembly scenarios
  observed in solutions of diblock copolymer stars with a solvophilic inner block
  and a solvophobic outer block. A variety of modeling approaches and simulation techniques
  at different levels of detail reveals that individual molecules assume configurations
  akin to patchy colloids, but with a patchiness that depends on physical parameters
  and can adjust to external stimuli such as temperature and pH. These soft, patchy
  building blocks inter-associate at finite concentrations into micellar or gel-like
  solutions, including spherical and wormlike micelles, or they display macroscopic
  phase separation. The connections between single-molecule conformation and the structure
  of the concentrated solution are discussed, and coarse-grained strategies for these
  novel molecular entities are critically compared to one another. © 2017 Elsevier

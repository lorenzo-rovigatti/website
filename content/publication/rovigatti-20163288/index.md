abstract: The fabrication of versatile building blocks that reliably self-assemble
  into desired ordered and disordered phases is amongst the hottest topics in contemporary
  materials science. To this end, microscopic units of varying complexity, aimed at
  assembling the target phases, have been thought, designed, investigated and built.
  Such a path usually requires laborious fabrication techniques, especially when specific
  functionalisation of the building blocks is required. Telechelic star polymers,
  i.e., star polymers made of a number of f di-block copolymers consisting of solvophobic
  and solvophilic monomers grafted on a central anchoring point, spontaneously self-assemble
  into soft patchy particles featuring attractive spots (patches) on the surface.
  Here we show that the tunability of such a system can be widely extended by controlling
  the physical and chemical parameters of the solution. Indeed, under fixed external
  conditions the self-assembly behaviour depends only on the number of arms and on
  the ratio of solvophobic to solvophilic monomers. However, changes in temperature
  and/or solvent quality make it possible to reliably change the number and size of
  the attractive patches. This allows the steering of the mesoscopic self-assembly
  behaviour without modifying the microscopic constituents. Interestingly, we also
  demonstrate that diverse combinations of the parameters can generate stars with
  the same number of patches but different radial and angular stiffness. This mechanism
  could provide a neat way of further fine-tuning the elastic properties of the supramolecular
  network without changing its topology. Â© 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

abstract: 'We investigate the structural chain-to-ring transition at low temperature
  in a gas of dipolar hard spheres (DHS). Due to the weakening of entropic contribution,
  ring formation becomes noticeable when the effective dipole-dipole magnetic interaction
  increases. It results in the redistribution of particles from usually observed flexible
  chains into flexible rings. The concentration (ρ) of DHS plays a crucial part in
  this transition: at a very low ρ only chains and rings are observed, whereas even
  a slight increase of the volume fraction leads to the formation of branched or defect
  structures. As a result, the fraction of DHS aggregated in defect-free rings turns
  out to be a non-monotonic function of ρ. The average ring size is found to be a
  slower increasing function of ρ when compared to that of chains. Both theory and
  computer simulations confirm the dramatic influence of the ring formation on the
  ρ-dependence of the initial magnetic susceptibility (χ) when the temperature decreases.
  The rings due to their zero total dipole moment are irresponsive to a weak magnetic
  field and drive to the strong decrease of the initial magnetic susceptibility. ©

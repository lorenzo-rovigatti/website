abstract: 'Globally ordered colloidal crystal lattices have broad utility in a wide
  range of optical and catalytic devices, for example, as photonic band gap materials.
  However, the self-assembly of stereospecific structures is often confounded by polymorphism.
  Small free-energy differences often characterize ensembles of different structures,
  making it difficult to produce a single morphology at will. Current techniques to
  handle this problem adopt one of two approaches: that of the \"top-down\" or \"bottom-up\"
  methodology, whereby structures are engineered starting from the largest or smallest
  relevant length scales, respectively. However, recently, a third approach for directing
  high fidelity assembly of colloidal crystals has been suggested which relies on
  the introduction of polymer cosolutes into the crystal phase [Mahynski, N.; Panagiotopoulos,
  A. Z.; Meng, D.; Kumar, S. K. Nat. Commun. 2014, 5, 4472]. By tuning the polymers
  morphology to interact uniquely with the void symmetry of a single desired crystal,
  the entropy loss associated with polymer confinement has been shown to strongly
  bias the formation of that phase. However, previously, this approach has only been
  demonstrated in the limiting case of close-packed crystals. Here, we show how this
  approach may be generalized and extended to complex open crystals, illustrating
  the utility of this \"structure-directing agent\" paradigm in engineering the nanoscale
  structure of ordered colloidal materials. The high degree of transferability of
  this paradigms basic principles between relatively simple crystals and more complex
  ones suggests that this represents a valuable addition to presently known self-assembly
  techniques. Â© 2016 American Chemical Society.'

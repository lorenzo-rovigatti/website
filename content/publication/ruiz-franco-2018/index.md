abstract: 'Abstract.: The numerical investigation of the statics and dynamics of systems
  in non-equilibrium in general, and under shear flow in particular, has become more
  and more common. However, not all the numerical methods developed to simulate equilibrium
  systems can be successfully adapted to out-of-equilibrium cases. This is especially
  true for thermostats. Indeed, even though thermostats developed to work under equilibrium
  conditions sometimes display good agreement with rheology experiments, their performance
  rapidly degrades beyond weak dissipation and small shear rates. Here we focus on
  gauging the relative performances of three thermostats, Langevin, dissipative particle
  dynamics, and Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello under varying parameters and external conditions.
  We compare their effectiveness by looking at different observables and clearly demonstrate
  that choosing the right thermostat (and its parameters) requires a careful evaluation
  of, at least, temperature, density and velocity profiles. We also show that small
  modifications of the Langevin and DPD thermostats greatly enhance their performance
  in a wide range of parameters. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].

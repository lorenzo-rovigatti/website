abstract: Simulations of nucleic acids at different levels of structural details are
  increasingly used to complement and interpret experiments in different fields, from
  biophysics to medicine and materials science. However, the various structural models
  currently available for DNA and RNA and their accompanying suites of computational
  tools can be very rarely used in a synergistic fashion. The tacoxDNA webserver and
  standalone software package presented here are a step toward a long-sought interoperability
  of nucleic acids models. The webserver offers a simple interface for converting
  various common input formats of DNA structures and setting up molecular dynamics
  (MD) simulations. Users can, for instance, design DNA rings with different topologies,
  such as knots, with and without supercoiling, by simply providing an XYZ coordinate
  file of the DNA centre-line. More complex DNA geometries, as designable in the cadnano,
  CanDo and Tiamat tools, can also be converted to all-atom or oxDNA representations,
  which can then be used to run MD simulations. Though the latter are currently geared
  toward the native and LAMMPS oxDNA representations, the open-source package is designed
  to be further expandable. TacoxDNA is available at http://tacoxdna.sissa.it. © 2019

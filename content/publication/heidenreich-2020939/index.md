abstract: 'Protein self-organization is a hallmark of biological systems. Although
  the physicochemical principles governing protein–protein interactions have long
  been known, the principles by which such nanoscale interactions generate diverse
  phenotypes of mesoscale assemblies, including phase-separated compartments, remain
  challenging to characterize. To illuminate such principles, we create a system of
  two proteins designed to interact and form mesh-like assemblies. We devise a new
  strategy to map high-resolution phase diagrams in living cells, which provide self-assembly
  signatures of this system. The structural modularity of the two protein components
  allows straightforward modification of their molecular properties, enabling us to
  characterize how interaction affinity impacts the phase diagram and material state
  of the assemblies in vivo. The phase diagrams and their dependence on interaction
  affinity were captured by theory and simulations, including out-of-equilibrium effects
  seen in growing cells. Finally, we find that cotranslational protein binding suffices
  to recruit a messenger RNA to the designed micron-scale structures. [Figure not

abstract: To simulate long time and length scale processes involving DNA it is necessary
  to use a coarse-grained description. Here we provide an overview of different approaches
  to such coarse-graining, focussing on those at the nucleotide level that allow the
  self-assembly processes associated with DNA nanotechnology to be studied. OxDNA,
  our recently-developed coarse-grained DNA model, is particularly suited to this
  task, and has opened up this field to systematic study by simulations. We illustrate
  some of the range of DNA nanotechnology systems to which the model is being applied,
  as well as the insights it can provide into fundamental biophysical properties of
  DNA. © 2013 the Owner Societies.

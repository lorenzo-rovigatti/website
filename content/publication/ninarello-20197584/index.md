abstract: Thermoresponsive microgels are soft colloids that find widespread use as
  model systems for soft matter physics. Their complex internal architecture, made
  of a disordered and heterogeneous polymer network, has been so far a major challenge
  for computer simulations. In this work, we put forward a coarse-grained model of
  microgels whose structural properties are in quantitative agreement with results
  obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering experiments across a wide range of temperatures,
  encompassing the volume phase transition. These results bridge the gap between experiments
  and simulations of individual microgel particles, paving the way to theoretically
  address open questions about their bulk properties with unprecedented nano- and
  microscale resolution. Copyright Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.

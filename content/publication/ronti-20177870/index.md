abstract: We employ a method based on Monte Carlo grand-canonical simulations to precisely
  calculate partition functions of non-interacting chains and rings formed by dipolar
  hard spheres (DHS) at low temperature. The extended low temperature region offered
  by such cluster calculations, compared to what had been previously achieved with
  standard simulations, opens up the possibility of exploring a part of the DHS phase
  diagram which was inaccessible before. The reported results offer the unique opportunity
  of verifying well-established theoretical models based on the ideal gas of cluster
  approximation in order to clarify their range of validity. They also provide the
  basis for future studies in which cluster-cluster interactions will be included.

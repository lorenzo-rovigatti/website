abstract: Thermoresponsive microgels are polymeric colloidal networks that can change
  their size in response to a temperature variation. This peculiar feature is driven
  by the nature of the solvent-polymer interactions, which triggers the so-called
  volume phase transition from a swollen to a collapsed state above a characteristic
  temperature. Recently, an advanced modelling protocol to assemble realistic, disordered
  microgels has been shown to reproduce experimental swelling behavior and form factors.
  In the original framework, the solvent was taken into account in an implicit way,
  condensing solvent-polymer interactions in an effective attraction between monomers.
  To go one step further, in this work we perform simulations of realistic microgels
  in an explicit solvent. We identify a suitable model which fully captures the main
  features of the implicit model and further provides information on the solvent uptake
  by the interior of the microgel network and on its role in the collapse kinetics.
  These results pave the way for addressing problems where solvent effects are dominant,
  such as the case of microgels at liquid-liquid interfaces. Â© 2018, The Author(s).

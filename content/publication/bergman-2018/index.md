abstract: Thermoresponsive microgels find widespread use as colloidal model systems,
  because their temperature-dependent size allows facile tuning of their volume fraction
  in situ. However, an interaction potential unifying their behavior across the entire
  phase diagram is sorely lacking. Here we investigate microgel suspensions in the
  fluid regime at different volume fractions and temperatures, and in the presence
  of another population of small microgels, combining confocal microscopy experiments
  and numerical simulations. We find that effective interactions between microgels
  are clearly temperature dependent. In addition, microgel mixtures possess an enhanced
  stability compared to hard colloid mixtures - a property not predicted by a simple
  Hertzian model. Based on numerical calculations we propose a multi-Hertzian model,
  which reproduces the experimental behavior for all studied conditions. Our findings
  highlight that effective interactions between microgels are much more complex than
  usually assumed, displaying a crucial dependence on temperature and on the internal
  core-corona architecture of the particles. © 2018, The Author(s).

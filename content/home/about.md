# Biography

My research revolves around soft condensed matter and self assembly. In particular, I am interested in the phase behaviour of systems composed by anisotropically interacting nano- and micro-sized particles.

My weapons of choice are computer simulations and theoretical approaches devised for the investigation of complex fluids. Some of the systems I have studied throughout my career are presented in the image gallery above.

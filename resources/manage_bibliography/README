* The bib_to_academic.py script requires the bibtexparser and unidecode packages (pip3 install --user bibtexparser unidecode).
* In order to update the publication markdown files, call the "bib_to_academic.py" script from the website's root folder and pass it a bib file containing the list of publications. Use SCOPUS to export the entries to have a unified output style.
* Remember to delete all the publication files before calling the script!
